A formal concept is an idea or category defined by a concrete or specific set of rules, guidelines, or properties. For a concept to be considered a formal concept then it must meet all of the guidelines and rules required to fit the concept or it is not included in the category.<br> 
We,Codebreakers has come up with the problem statement of 'use of formal definitions for illustrating a novel and representation of its characters and their emotions and relationships  using graphs'.<br>
More specifically,it would be better if we can formalize every possible thing in a manner there is a formal definition for them rather than intuitive thinking. So that any intelligent machine can analyse it.Machines cannot think intutively.They require inputs,rules and definitions based on which they operate.If we can formalize difficult domains like literature where one's intuition and imaginations have a great effect,we can incorporate the same to a machine and use in in behavior analysis and many other applications.<br>
One of which is automated theorem proving.It would be better if a system could prove theorems on their own without manual intervention.
We have to use rules defined by propositional and predicate logic for formalising the literature or novel.
